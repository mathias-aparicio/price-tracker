#Roadmap

1. Make it available in github
2. Add more indexs such as: Vietnamese stocks, S&P 500 etc, NFTs
3. Discord bot that checks all NFT discord servers for messages from founders that could drive up price. And then display it on the website. 
4. Volume alert, when the current 30 min volume exceeds the previous or last 3 week's 30 min volume bar at the same time by a factor 4. Example: volume at Sunday 16:30-17:00 this week is 500M and the previous week volume at Sunday 16:30-17:30 is 500M/4. An alert should happen.
5. Automatic trading? That requires a lot more backend logic, testing, but can be done progressivly
